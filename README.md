POO1 - LEVEL 1

=> 21-JAN-25: LEVELS 2 & 3

ðŸ“„ EXERCISES DESCRIPTION

LEVEL 1
- Exercise 1: Create class Employee, attributes: name and salary. Define "initialize" method, parameters: name and salary. Define "print" method: prints name and a message telling if employee has to pay taxes (if salary > 6000 pays taxes).
- Exercise 2: Write a program that defines a Shape class with a constructor that receives the width and height as parameters. Define two subclasses: Triangle and Rectangle that inherit from Shape and that respectively calculate the area of â€‹â€‹the shape.

LEVEL 2
- Exercise 1: Create the PokerDice class. The faces of a poker dice have the following figures: Ace, K, Q, J, 7 and 8. Create the throw method that does nothing more than roll the dice, that is, it generates a random value for the object to which the method is applied (*aleatory setter*). Also create the shapeName method, which says what figure came out in the last roll of the dice in question (*getter*). Create an application that allows you to roll five poker dice at once. Also, program the getTotalThrows method that should display the total number of rolls among all the dices.

LEVEL 3
- Exercise 1: Imagine that you have to present the movie catalog of a cinema chain. Each cinema has a name, a town where it belongs, and a list of movies. Each movie has a name, a duration, and a director. The idea is to make a program that allows us to record this information for later:
    * For each cinema, display the data of each movie.
    * For each cinema, display the movie with the longest duration.
    * Implement a function that searches for movies in different cinemas by the name of the director. There is no need to repeat movies.
In addition, you can take advantage of this exercise to work on a good presentation with HTML+CSS that supports the logic.
